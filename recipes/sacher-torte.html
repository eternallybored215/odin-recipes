            <li>Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake the cake in the center of the oven for 35 to 40 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the cake comes out with a few moist crumbs attached. Let the cake cool completly. Invert the cake onto a plate and peel off the parchment. Turn the cake right side up. Using a long serated knife, cut the cake horizontally into three even layers.</li>
