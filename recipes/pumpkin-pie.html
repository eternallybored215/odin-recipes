            <li>1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/3 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 teasponns cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon cardamom</li>
            <li>1/2 finely grated lemon zest</li>
            <li>2 cups homemade pumpkin purée or 1(15-ounce) can pumpkin purée.</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream or 1(12.ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
            <li>1 homemade pie crust or 2 frozen premade pie shells</li>
           </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:
            <ol>
                <li>If using a homemade pie crust, line a deep-dish pie pan and freeze for at least 30 minutes (1 or 2 hours is better).If using store-bought frozen crusts, simply unwrap them just before using. You will need 2.</li>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 425°F. Position a rack in the bottom 1/3 of the oven.</li>
                <li>Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Mix in the brown sugar, white sugar, salt, cinnamon, ground ginger, nutmeg, ground cloves, cardamom and lemon zest.
                    Mix in the pumpkin purée.Stir in the cream. Beat together until everything is well mixed. The mixture will be runny but will set up in oven.
                </li>
                <li>Pour the filling into 1 chilled homemeade deep-dish pie crust or 2 premade frozen pie shells. Bake in the oven at a high temperature of 425°F for 15 minutes.
                    After 15 minutes, lower the temperature to 350°F.The pie is done when a knife tip inserted in the center comes out wet but relatively clean. The center should be just barely jiggly. For one deep-dish pie, this will take 50 to 60 minutes more. For 2 shallow pies, bake for 35 to 45 minutes more.
                    Note that the pumpkin pie will come out of the oven all puffed up, and will deflate as it cools.  
                </li>
                <li>Cool the pumpkin on a wire rack for 2 hours. Serve with whipped cream.
                    You can leave cooled pumpkin pie on the counter for up to 4 hours, then wrap it tightly and move it to the fridge for up to 3 days. If possible let it come to room temperature before serving.
                    For longer storage, tightly wrap individual slices or a whole, cooled pie. and freeze for up tp 1 month. Defrost overnight in the fridge and let come to room temperature before serving.
